# [CLRS](https://github.com/frc123/CLRS)

This repo includes 

- C++ code implementation of data structures and algorithms

- exercise and problem solutions of "Introduction to Algorithms" (CLRS) 3rd edition 
(in LaTeX and handwriting)
(the handwriting part will be updated to LaTeX)

For those who starred the repo, we really appreciate it.
Your star is our motivation to do better.

## Submodules of the Project

### [Matrix](https://github.com/frc123/matrix)

Matrix library that supports operator overloading and Strassen's algorithm.

### [Red-Black Trees](https://github.com/frc123/red-black-tree)

Basic STL style red-black trees.

### [Persistent Red-Black Trees](https://github.com/frc123/persistent-red-black-tree)

- Red-black trees
that maintain past versions of a red-black tree.

- Guarantee O(lg n) running time and space
per selection insertion, or deletion.

### [Order Statistics Trees + Interval Trees](https://github.com/frc123/augment-red-black-tree)

- Order Statistics Trees: Red-black trees
that support computation of the rank of an elements in O(lg n).

- Interval Trees: Red-black trees
that support operations on intervals.
